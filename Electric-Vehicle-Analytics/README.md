🗂️ Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains electric vehicle registration details from 2012 to 2024.
It includes information such as vehicle make and model, EV type (BEV or PHEV), model year, electric range, state-wise registration, and CAFV eligibility status.

Overall, the dataset covers 89,966 electric vehicles, which makes it suitable for understanding adoption trends, manufacturer dominance, and eligibility distribution.

🧹 Data Cleaning & Processing

Before building the Tableau dashboard, the dataset was reviewed and prepared to make it suitable for analysis.
The following steps were performed:

Removed duplicate vehicle records

Checked and handled missing or inconsistent values

Standardized manufacturer and model names for consistency

Categorized vehicles into BEV and PHEV for comparison

Processed CAFV eligibility values (Eligible, Not Eligible, Unknown)

Aggregated data for year-wise, state-wise, and manufacturer-level analysis

These steps helped ensure the visuals were accurate and easy to interpret.

📊 Analysis Performed

Using Tableau, the dataset was analyzed to understand:

Growth of electric vehicles over the years

Distribution of BEV vs PHEV vehicles

Top manufacturers and models by total vehicles

Average electric range trends

State-wise EV adoption patterns

CAFV eligibility distribution

Interactive filters were added to allow users to explore the data by EV type, model, and state.

🎓 What I Learned from This Project

Working on this project helped me:

Understand real-world EV adoption trends

Improve my data cleaning and preparation approach

Learn how to convert raw data into meaningful KPIs

Gain confidence in using Tableau for trend and map-based analysis

Improve dashboard layout and visual clarity for business users

This project also helped me think more from a business and analysis perspective, not just visualization.

✅ Summary

This Tableau dashboard provides a clear overview of electric vehicle trends and highlights important patterns related to growth, manufacturers, and eligibility.
The project reflects my hands-on learning experience with real data and my ability to analyze and present insights using Tableau.
